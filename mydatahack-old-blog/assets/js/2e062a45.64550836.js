Understanding the clean code principles makes your code much more bug-free, scalable and maintainable. The examples are based on Java. It has a lot of focus on OOP. However, the principles can be applied to any programming paradigm. It will make you not only a better programmer, but also a better peer reviewer. By understanding these principles, you can be articulate about the reason why a certain block of code can be improved. My recommendation is to read through this book and apply these principles when you write code every day. Clean code can be easier said than done.
