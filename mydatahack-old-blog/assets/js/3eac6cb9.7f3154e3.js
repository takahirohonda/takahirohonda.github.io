It has own template language base on Ruby, called Liquid. You don\u2019t really need to know much about Ruby, but need to learn the Liquid syntax. Luckily, the documentation is really good. As it has a large user base, you can pretty much google your issues and answers can be found. However, I found the capability of liquid syntax is limited compared to making a static site with Gatsby as you can use full power of JavaScript. Learning the syntax has its own learning curve although it is not steep, but can be annoying.
