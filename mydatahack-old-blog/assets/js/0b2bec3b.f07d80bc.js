Once you have a data frame, it becomes easier to do clean up. I removed the title page, chapter title and the last two lines which are not the part of the novel. I also removed some special characters. I kept the chapter number because this can be dealt with tm later. For this part, you really need to look at the pdf you download and decide what to remove.

I set min.freq = 80 and max.words = 100. 100 words per word cloud is a good place to start. I usually determine min.freq by looking at the document term matrix (see step 6).
