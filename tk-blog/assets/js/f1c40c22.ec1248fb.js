The ground was still damp from the evening rain. All I remembered was a flash of light. The next moment I saw three green men, or maybe women, but who knows I've never seen a woman in real life, standing right in front of me. They spoke in an alien language, their voices coming from a speaker attached to the collars of their space suits. No doubt hostile and ready to take us over. Their planet probably became uninhabitable, possibly from nuking each others. Their tech looked super advance.

The cleaner found tiny sharks swimming in the shark tank where all of them were female one day. They reported the findings to their superior. Calls were made.

Scientists concluded the absence of the males rewired the female reproductive system."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A similar phenomenon was observed among a captive exclusively female population of zebra at a zoo in Toronto. A baby zebra was discovered by a zookeeper who entered the enclosure to top up their food pile of hay and alfalfa at the start of their shift. Genetic tests confirmed that the cub was in fact from one of the zebras from the herd. They also had identical zebra patterns. Each zebra has unique patterns on their body. Up to that point, the scientists debated if the patterns were formed genetically or environmentally. It settled the debate. Zebras inherit their patterns from their parents. The environment has no influence."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Asexual reproduction observed in a mammalian species shocked the world. Videos of the phenomenon went viral, turning it into a global social sensation. That year, the zoo saw a 1000% surge in visitor numbers. A meme coin based on the zebra and countless NFTs were created. It of course fuelled a wave of conspiracy theories, most of which blamed either a pharmaceutical company or secret government military projects. Some floated the idea that covid vaccinations might be the cause. However, the scientific consensus concluded that the absence of male presence triggered changes in brain chemistry, adjusting hormone production to initiate egg cell division without a fertilisation event."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It was only a matter of time for this phenomenon to be observed among an exclusively female monkey population in captivity."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The first instance of asexual reproduction in humans was observed in a women's prison in Baltimore.

It caused the male population to decline quickly. As the population balance shifted, women took power and decided to make men obsolete. Why the hell not? They are stupid. The World Congress unanimously passed a law banning sexual reproduction and legally classifying all men as incompetent. The remaining men were herded into a designated humanitarian reserve, the location of which remained secret.

Fair enough - sperm is useless. These hostile aliens no doubt have ray guns. They'll shoot me and slaughter the rest of the women. I'm going to either evaporate instantly or pop like a balloon. Whatever. Since I am the last man standing, no doubt I have the biggest penis on Earth. We human will not go down without a fight.
