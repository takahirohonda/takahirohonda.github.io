I worked as a salesman for a company that sells correspondence vocational education.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Women’s prisons in Japan are run only by women. Even the prison guards are women. Female prisoners are deprived of men.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Apparently, there are always a few prisoners who start taking off their clothes whenever they see a man. No matter how ugly he is, it really doesn’t matter. They get so excited about the mere presence of opposite-sex. Taking off their clothes results in a punishment. They have to spend a period of time in an isolation room without any window. They don’t care. They risk it anyway. In the moment of madness, the animal instinct kicks in.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>When I visited a jail for the first time, a young woman prisoner took off her clothes as I was walking by her cell. She put her right fist up in her vagina. Before the prison guard had time to get in her cell and beat her up, she managed to have an intense shaking orgasm.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>After the incident, she was sent to an isolation cell for 14 days. She eventually completed training to be an aged carer before she was released. I think of her whenever I see an aged care center.

<br /><br /></p>

<p>I was making graffiti in Shibuya and two police officers came. I was using red spray paint and got literally caught red-handed. I got arrested and put in a detention center. Someone from the Australian embassy visited me there. I was told I would have to spend the minimum of 3 months and the maximum of 8 years if I was to be charged. I was stressed. It would suck to spend that much time in jail.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I was sharing a cell with 2 people, the old and young. The old guy was arrested for tax fraud. He didn’t speak English at all. He had a photo of his Lamborghini. He looked at the photo all the time. The young one spoke English. He got arrested for robbing a liquor store.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Food was good there. We had miso soup every meal.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I didn’t get charged. I was released after 2 weeks. That was how I got caught red-handed in Japan.

<p>and carefully traced the concentric rings one by one with my finger.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>A piece of dirty yellowish brown cloth was floating on the water.</p>

<p>I swam towards the artefact to inspect it,</p>

<p>It was a dead body of me.</p>

<p>My feet touched the sandy bottom and I thought to myself,</p>

<p>the shore is near.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I stood on the land, on the wet sand.</p>

<p>Charcoaled wood pieces, campfire remains,</p>

<p>I walked towards the sand dunes with tiny crabs,</p>

<p>Towards the saltbush shrubs before sea level rise and storm surge.</p>

<p>In the twilight of the empire, I saw two red moons in the sky.

<br /><br /></p>

<p>The origin of pole jumping goes way back before humans invented a bridge. Our ancestors used a long stick made out of a tree to boost themselves to jump over rivers. It was an essential survival skill.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>We had to to stop them from crossing the river. They hate water. After all the bridges were destroyed, the only method for us to cross rivers was to use a long flexible stick. You would run towards the bank, stick it on the ground, and propel yourself to the other side, just like a pole jumper.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>We have gone back to the way of our ancestors.
